**Post-Doc Recruitment in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks**

The Intelligent Network and Computing Research Centre at Fudan University has two openings for Postdoctoral Researchers in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGIN). The successful candidates will contribute research to the advancements in SAGIN, with a particular focus on:

**Position 1: Advanced SAGIN Simulation Prototyping**: 
* Design, implement and test inter-satellite information exchange modules
* Develop, implement, and test simulation for satellite-to-ground/satellite-to-satellite link physical layer capabilities. 
* Design, implement and test simulate satellite-to-cellular service framework
 
**Position 2: SAGIN Control Plane Design & SAGIN Resource Management**:
* Design and evaluate path computation algorithms for efficient end to end path computation, recovery path computation, etc., in SAGIN.
*• Design distributed satellites state synchronization mechanism for supporting scalable SAGIN control plane.
*• Design resource management strategy to fully utilize SAGIN resource.

**Interested candidates should meet the following criteria**:
* Holding or expected to obtain a PhD degree (or equivalent) in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science/Engineering or related disciplines
* Strong background in network knowledge (Ethernet/Wi-Fi/5G), with focus on Layer 2+ (MAC, IP and Application)
* Solid programming/scripting skills (e.g., C/C++, Python)
* Quick comprehension and excellent analytical skills
* Ability to conduct independent research as well as collaborate in a team
* Excellent written and communication skills in English

**For Position 1, it is a strong plus if candidates have**:
* Hands-on experience programming NS-3 platforms
* Prior research experience with network testbeds and performing link-level measurements
* Research experience in routing system (OSPF/FIB/MPLS/OpenFlow, etc.)

**For Position 2, it is a strong plus if candidates have**:
* Research experience in software-defined networks (SDN), with a focus on scalable control plane design
* Hands-on experience with network simulators, e.g., ns-3
* Research experience in consistency mechanism of distributed system, such as weak/strong consistency and eventual consistency.
* Research experience in resource management modeling for cloud-native network, cellular core network, etc.

Qualified candidates are invited to submit their applications to Prof. Yue Gao via email (inc_hr@fudan.edu.cn) by including:
* CV
* transcripts of records
* a brief account of why you want to conduct research, your academic interests
* and how they relate to your previous studies and future goals (max 2 pages)
* contact of two Referees.

The positions are to be filled at the earliest possible date and are offered for a fixed term of two years, on a full-time basis with a salary corresponding to the pay grade and salary scale upon candidate’s experience.

Application deadline: **31/05/2024** (incoming applications will be continuously evaluated)
